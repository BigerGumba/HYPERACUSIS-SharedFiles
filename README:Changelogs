Hello and welcome to the digital archive of my Video Game Passion Project, also known as Hyperacusis!
This repository contains a playable (but very much incomplete) demo build of the game, and some clips of the game at various stages of development.

UPDATE v0.3.1 CHANGELOG
-Added new chair type for Science desks
-Fixed bugs with Science
-Added Easels in Art rooms
-Added Computers in the Computer Lab
-Added furniture to Library (still incomplete though :P)
-Teacher now avoids furniture
-Added Pause/Menu transitions
-Added a new item which boosts Stamina without affecting noise
-Added use sound effects for Pretzels

This is a pretty minor update and it's a shame that it took so long, but now that school is over development will hopefully become steady again.

UPDATE v0.3.0 CHANGELOG
New Teacher Interactions:
-Changed the appearance of the Teacher to a different placeholder that fits the style of the game better lol
-Added the Mug item, which can be used on the new Coffee Machine object to turn it into Coffee. Give the Coffee to the Teacher (like An Apple for Baldi) to cause them to retreat to the faculty lounge for some time. 
-Added Paper Airplanes, another defensive item which can be thrown at the Teacher to cause them to catch it and take time to put it in the nearest trash can. (the Teacher becomes unable to end the game only AFTER they start moving)
-Added Drinking Fountains which can generate a pool of water to slip up the Teacher if a Banknote is inserted.
-Replaced the old test map with a new one designed specifically to test all these new mechanics!

Other:
-Settings now FINALLY save between sessions!
-Added a logo to the Main Menu as well as a Credits page (Menu's still far from done)
-New sounds for vending machines, the Pretzels item, and aforementioned trash cans.
-Interacting with the exit door with all tablets in a level now returns the player to the title screen (a real ending is obviously planned for v1.0).
-Replaced most furniture
-The legs of the Science Desk and Teacher Desk objects are now low-poly
-New Advanced variants of the Energy Drink and Smoke Can
-Answering questions incorrectly is now more punishing on Volume
-Added Math impossible problem. When you get to it, try to type in an answer! (as a reminder you gotta go into settings and change "ALL SUBJECTS" to "[name] ONLY" to see the different impossible problems)
-Nerfed English subject. Now each module has one less box, making the first English tablet(s) quite easy but the last one(s) hard but much less nerve-wracking than before.
	-To accommodate this new feature the impossible English question was also changed. One might find the old texture to be better, and I agree, but the distortion will probably be created with a Shader effect in the future.
-Fixed a bug where spamming "Submit" on Science tablets cheeses them
-New Furniture Objects:
	-Coffee Machine
	-Round Table
	-Whiteboard (multiple variations)
-Other extremely minor changes

Minor updates to this version will consist of making the game look better and removing placeholders. v0.4.0 will focus on adding some new characters that will add more... functionality... to the Volume meter.

UPDATE v0.2.1 CHANGELOG
-Basic difficulty is fully functional woohoo
-Added the impossible questions for Science and English; Math's impossible question will come in the next update
-Unscrambling English sentences is now done by swapping the positions of two pieces at a time
-Science tablets now have a feedback panel which tells you what the correct answer was for a brief moment after pressing "submit". This not only allows players to master Science through memorization but also makes Science tablets less easy as you're now forced to spend more time in them.
-Removed the Teacher's Debug trail. oops
-Made the Teacher's Thump sound quieter on higher difficulties and less audible overall.
-Doors now have a wider detection range for closing, making them easier to open

I promise to bring back all furniture back by the next update

UPDATE v0.2.0 CHANGELOG
-Added the Teacher! Of course the current sprite and jumpscare sound effect are placeholders, but their general Chasing AI is essentially finished!
-Added English subject, although the method of answering questions is currently too slow and will be adjusted in the future.
-Rebuilt the Structuring system from the ground up, allowing for more dynamic structures
-Added chairs for the lonely desks
-Added Vending Machines. Use the new Banknote item to buy snacks such as Pretzels (1 note) and Energy Drinks (2 notes)! (right click with Banknotes to insert them, left click on the machine to take an item)
-Added the Smoke Can item, which boosts movement speed and makes you invincible for 7 seconds. It makes a lot of noise, however.

v0.2.1 will come next, which will rebalance the existing subjects and add environment pausing to Basic difficulty.


UPDATE v0.1.0 CHANGELOG
-Made the Main Menu look a bit better
-Created the entire school map- will have more decorations and structures by v1.0.0
-Added lighting to the main map so you don't have to crank up your brightness. BBiEaL's chunk-based system will come later
-Added a fog effect that appears after solving the first tablet outside of Free Run difficulty; it will intensify the higher the volume bar gets!
-Added the Pill item and the (currently useless) Coin item
-Improved View Bobbing

UPDATE v0.0.1 CHANGELOG (late but relevant)
-Fixed missing textures

v0.0.0 FEATURES
-Main Menu(incomplete)
-Functional inventory and items
-Doors (comes in normal/swinging and locked/unlocked types; also makes a sound when using)
-Multiple wall/floor/ceiling types and furniture
-*Volume Mechanic*
  -Various player actions and outside forces will increment volume (currently, only way of doing so is using the Energy Drink item); If the Volume Bar stays at 100% for_long enough, you lose
-Game Over Screen **BLOOD/GORE WARNING**
-Tablets (only the Red (math) and Blue (science) tablets work)
-Difficulty settings (currently cannot be changed; some features accessible at higher/lower difficulties exist but are unimplemented)

Planned features include:
-More Items, Furnitures, and other decorative textures
-More SFX and Musics
-More Subjects
-Settings (settings exist in_the code but cannot be edited in_game)
-NavMesh agents
-Spooky effects!!1!
-Cutscenes

**PLAYER CONTROLS**
  -WASD to move
  -Mouse to look around
  -LMB or E key to Interact (pick up items, open doors, etc)
  -RMB or Q to use the currently selected item (with the Restroom Key, face the door before using)
  -Scroll Wheel or 1/2/3/4 to switch inventory slot
  -Hold SHIFT to run (watch your Stamina!)
  -Hold CONTROL to cover ears (intentionally prevents interaction; currently useless)
  -While in tablets, press SHIFT to clear the answer and ENTER to submit it (or just click the buttons); answering all 3 examples will make you exit automatically
