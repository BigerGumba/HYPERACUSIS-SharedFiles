Hello and welcome to the digital archive of my Video Game Passion Project, also known as Hyperacusis!
This repository contains a playable (but very much incomplete) demo build of the game, and some clips of the game at various stages of development.

UPDATE v0.2.0 CHANGELOG
-Added the Teacher! Of course the current sprite and jumpscare sound effect are placeholders, but their general Chasing AI is essentially finished!
-Added English subject, although the method of answering questions is currently too slow and will be adjusted in the future.
-Rebuilt the Structuring system from the ground up, allowing for more dynamic structures
-Added chairs for the lonely desks
-Added Vending Machines. Use the new Banknote item to buy snacks such as Pretzels (1 note) and Energy Drinks (2 notes)! (right click with Banknotes to insert them, left click on the machine to take an item)
-Added the Smoke Can item, which boosts movement speed and makes you invincible for 7 seconds. It makes a lot of noise, however.

v0.2.1 will come next, which will rebalance the existing subjects and add environment pausing to Basic mode.


UPDATE v0.1.0 CHANGELOG
-Made the Main Menu look a bit better
-Created the entire school map- will have more decorations and structures by v1.0.0
-Added lighting to the main map so you don't have to crank up your brightness. BBiEaL's chunk-based system will come later
-Added a fog effect that appears after solving the first tablet outside of Free Run difficulty; it will intensify the higher the volume bar gets!
-Added the Pill item and the (currently useless) Coin item
-Improved View Bobbing


v0.0.0 FEATURES
-Main Menu(incomplete)
-Functionable inventory and items
-Doors (comes in normal/swinging and locked/unlocked types; also makes a sound when using)
-Multiple wall/floor/ceiling types and furniture
-*Volume Mechanic*
  -Various player actions and outside forces will increment volume (currently, only way of doing so is using the Energy Drink item); If the Volume Bar stays at 100% for_long enough, you lose
-Game Over Screen **BLOOD/GORE WARNING**
-Tablets (only the Red (math) and Blue (science) tablets work)
-Difficulty settings (currently cannot be changed; some features accessible at higher/lower difficulties exist but are unimplemented)

Planned features include:
-More Items, Furnitures, and other decorative textures
-More SFX and Musics
-More Subjects
-Settings (settings exist in_the code but cannot be edited in_game)
-NavMesh agents
-Spooky effects!!1!
-Cutscenes

**PLAYER CONTROLS**
  -WASD to move
  -Mouse to look around
  -LMB or E key to Interact (pick up items, open doors, etc)
  -RMB or Q to use the currently selected item (with the Restroom Key, face the door before using)
  -Scroll Wheel or 1/2/3/4 to switch inventory slot
  -Hold SHIFT to run (watch your Stamina!)
  -Hold CONTROL to cover ears (intentionally prevents interaction; currently useless)
  -While in tablets, press SHIFT to clear the answer and ENTER to submit it (or just click the buttons); answering all 3 examples will make you exit automatically
