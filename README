Hello and welcome to the digital archive of my Video Game Passion Project, also known as Hyperacusis!
This repository contains a playable (but very much incomplete) demo build of the game, and some clips of the game at various stages of development.

Features currently implemented into the demo (v0.0.0) build include:
-Main Menu(incomplete)
-Functionable inventory and items
-Doors (comes in normal/swinging and locked/unlocked types; also makes a sound when using)
-Multiple wall/floor/ceiling types and furniture
-*Volume Mechanic*
  -Various player actions and outside forces will increment volume (currently, only way of doing so is using the Energy Drink item); If the Volume Bar stays at 100% for_long enough, you lose
-Game Over Screen **MILD BLOOD/GORE WARNING**
-Tablets (only the Red one (math) works)
-Difficulty settings (currently cannot be changed; some features accessible at higher/lower difficulties exist but are unimplemented)

Planned features include:
-More Items, Furnitures, and other decorative textures
-More SFX and Musics
-More Subjects
-Settings (settings exist in_the code but cannot be edited in_game)
-NavMesh agents
-Spooky effects!!1!
-Cutscenes

**PLAYER CONTROLS**
  -WASD or IJKL to move
  -Mouse to look around
  -LMB or E key to Interact (pick up items, open doors, etc)
  -RMB or Q to use the currently selected item (with the Restroom Key, face the door before using)
  -Scroll Wheel or 1/2/3/4 to switch inventory slot
  -Hold SHIFT to run (watch your Stamina!)
  -Hold CONTROL to cover ears (intentionally prevents interaction; currently useless)
  -While in tablets, press BACKSPACE to clear the answer ENTER to submit it (or just use your mouse); answering all 3 examples will make you exit automatically
